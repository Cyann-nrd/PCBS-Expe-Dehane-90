# Is Numerical Comparison Digital? Analogical and Symbolic Effects in Two-Digit Number Comparison

Replication of the expertiment of **Is Numerical Comparison Digital? Analogical and Symbolic Effects in Two-Digit Number Comparison** by Stanislas Dehaene, Emmanuel Dupoux and Jacques Mehler in 1990. 
The aim of this study is to investigate the distance effect. It is the increasing of reaction time for deciding which of two digits is the largest when the numerical distance between the two decreases.
